#### DEPLOYABLE BIKE 2.8.2

**version 2.8.1 updates the code for Epoch Mod 1.0.6. Thanks @ebayShopper!**

**version 2.8.0 adds options for conditional display of actions & options for clearing ammo from vehicles**

Out of the box, it adds a deployable bike with a right click action on a toolbox and a couple other neat deployables.

Really, it can be used to deploy **just about anything**. See the [configuration](#configuration) section below.

#### Features

* deploy cars/vehicles/props
* optional database saving
* Epoch building system
* optional part requirements
* configurable repacking for each object based on damage limit/owner/etc
* optional plot requirements for each item
* optionally require nearby items like epoch (fire/fueltank/workshop)

-----

#### Planned
* even better positioning when deploying
* possible ui overhaul

-----

#### Installation

 1. [download the files](https://github.com/mudzereli/DayZEpochDeployableBike/archive/master.zip "download files")
 2. extract the **addons** and **overwrites** folder from the downloaded zip file into **your mission file root**
 3. find this line in your mission file **init.sqf** (**warning**: if you have a custom compiles file, find that line instead of the one below!)
   * ```call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf";```
 4. place this line directly after the line you found
   * ```call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "addons\bike\init.sqf";```
 4. edit **addons\bike\config.sqf** to change some options or add different deployables ([see configuration section for more info](#configuration))

##### Warning:
- due to the way the way arma handles numbers and the way addon is coded, using the save-to-database option may not allow you to re-pack some objects if you have Character ID's over 500,000 (which I don't think will be an issue for 99.99% of people).

#### Configuration

This addon is highly configurable, you can deploy just about anything, not just bikes. 

open **addons\bike\config.sqf** and edit the array.

##### DZE_DEPLOYABLES_CONFIG array

format (note no comma after last array entry)
```sqf
 DZE_DEPLOYABLES_CONFIG = [
     [_clickItem,_deployOffset,_packDistance,_damageLimit,_packAny,_cargo,_ammo,_hive,_plot,_simulation,_road,_deployables,_near,_parts,_condition],
     [_clickItem,_deployOffset,_packDistance,_damageLimit,_packAny,_cargo,_ammo,_hive,_plot,_simulation,_road,_deployables,_near,_parts,_condition],
     [...more stuff here...]
 ];
```

array parameters

#### FAQ

1) People are getting kicked for createvehicle restriction when building things, what do I do?

Either edit the config file and change the items that are built, or open your battleye filter **createvehicle.txt** and find the associated line and add an entry for the building.

**Example for adding the Stone Wall that is deployed from the E-Tool (the class names can be found in the config)**
>
> open createvehicle.txt
>
> find this
>
> ```5 "Fort_" !="Fort_RazorWire" !="Fort_RazorWirePreview"```
>
> change it to to this:
>
> ```5 "Fort_" !="Fort_RazorWire" !="Fort_RazorWirePreview" != "Fort_StoneWall_EP1"```
